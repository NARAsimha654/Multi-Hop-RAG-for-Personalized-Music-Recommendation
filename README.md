## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** model to provide personalized music recommendations. By leveraging **multi-hop reasoning**, **dense and sparse retrieval**, and **transformer-based text generation**, the system enhances music recommendations based on user queries and past listening history.

The system retrieves relevant song metadata, lyrics, and user preferences before generating recommendations using **LLMs (Large Language Models)**.

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Personalized Music Recommendations** based on user profiles and past interactions  
✅ **Multi-Hop Reasoning** for complex queries (e.g., "Find me songs like Artist X but with upbeat jazz elements")  
✅ **Hybrid Retrieval** combining **Dense (FAISS)** and **Sparse (BM25)** search for relevant music data  
✅ **Transformer-based LLMs** for natural language response generation  
✅ **Scalable API** using FastAPI for real-time recommendations
